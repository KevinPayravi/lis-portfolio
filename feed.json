I'm Kevin, a recent MLIS graduate.\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    I graduated from Kent State University's Master's in Library and Information Science program in August 2022. This is my portfolio, created as part of my LIS60280 Master's Portfolio to highlight my accomplishments throughout my studies.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I was born and raised in Northeast Ohio, and currently work as a software engineer in Dallas, Texas.&nbsp;In addition to my job, I'm passionate about open source and accessibility to free knowledge. I've been an avid Wikipedia editor for over 10 years, and have since branched out to contribute to a variety of other wikis and free information projects. This includes deciding to pursue my MLIS, to prepare myself to work in the intersection of technology and librarianship.\n  </p>\n<div><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yhN3H4nQb-I\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div>\n\n  <p>\n    If you'd like to talk, feel free to <a href=\"https://lis.kevinpayravi.com/contact-me/\">reach out to me</a>!\n  </p>",
