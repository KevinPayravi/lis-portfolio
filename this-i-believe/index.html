We'd check out endless stacks of books as well as games for our Windows 95 PC at home. I looked forward to the summer for when the annual reading challenge would start; the more we read, the more turns we had to play the summer reading board game and win prizes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a short while at home, I also got to enjoy cable television with the Nickelodeon wonders of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpongeBob</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doug</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rugrats</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, after my mom watched a few episodes with me, she decided to cancel our cable and cast us into the world of PBS–and for the better. Growing up with shows </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arthur</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyberchase</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOVA</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was not only entertaining, but got me excited about topics like science and math.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back, I was raised in an environment where I got to take advantage of great free public services for learning, and I have a great appreciation of being able to do so.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I grew older, the Internet became more mainstream, and with that came easy access to even more free information (although the dial-up disconnections that would occur when someone picked up the phone were not so easy). Wikipedia started to take hold over the years, and one day I found myself reading an article about one of my favorite online games and realizing that I had some information I could add. It was, after all, known as the encyclopedia that anyone can edit. I made my first Wikipedia edit in 2007 at the age of 12 by adding some gameplay details to the page. Soon after I became hooked, contributing to articles on videogames and helping revert vandal edits. It was amazing to be able to contribute to a global source of free information alongside others. It did not matter that I was just a young middle schooler; I could still find my place and positively contribute to this project.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Editing Wikipedia became a regular hobby of mine, and I expanded the ways I'd contribute. I found myself regularly uploading photos, helping new users, and reviewing new articles. When I entered college, I became involved in the offline scene by creating a student organization about Wikipedia, helping organize and attend Wikimedia conferences, and collaborating with museums and libraries to host events.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I learned more about librarianship, I realized my passions aligned well with core library values. My work with open knowledge projects has aligned with virtually all of the American Library Association's Core values, though the one I am most passionate about is Access. Giving someone the ability to freely access information can unlock a trove of opportunity as it did for me, and I want everyone in the world to have that access. I decided to pursue a master's degree in Library and Information Science, to better understand the world of librarianship and to unlock opportunities to shift my career to focus on the LIS field.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">References</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Core Values of Librarianship", American Library Association, July 26, 2006. </span><a href="http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/corevalues"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/corevalues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Accessed July 6, 2022).</span></p></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://lis.kevinpayravi.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://lis.kevinpayravi.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
